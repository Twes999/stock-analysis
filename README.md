# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that I did in this module, but with for the entire stock market and hopefully in a shorter amount of time.

# Results
-In 2018 all stocks were down with the exception of two (ENPH & RUN)
-In 2017 it was the opposite, all stocks were up except for TERP.
